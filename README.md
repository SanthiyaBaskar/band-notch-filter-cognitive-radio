## 📝 Project Overview

This project presents the design and simulation of a **Reconfigurable Band-Notch Filter (BNF)** for use in **Cognitive Radio (CR)** systems, particularly within defense communication networks. The objective is to dynamically suppress unwanted interference by altering the notch frequency, ensuring enhanced signal clarity and system adaptability.
